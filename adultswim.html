                        <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
                        <p>When first thinking about the Adult Swim redesign I began researching the history and background of the company. Trying to better understand the brand as a whole and what they are trying to convey about themselves to their audience. From what I understood they wanted to portray themselves as an animation network for adults with an adult sense of humor.</p>

                        <p><img src="img/adultswim/aszerotwo.JPG" alt="Book cover sketch ideas" /></p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h3>Sketching</h3>
                        <p>When I figured out what the network was I began the sketching phase, sketching up to 200 ideas on to paper. These ideas were round one of coming up with the logo design. Round two of sketching took the best ideas from round one and extrapolating what made them great. Which was the humor aspect that came from the logos. I refined the sketches and tried to make them funnier as well.</p>

                        <h3>Final</h3>
                        <p>The end result of this process was a logo system which allowed for many "punchlines" or jokes that could arise from the logo itself. The design is a pool that can feature an array of goofy characters/creatures even characters from the Adult Swim shows could show up. This final design best conveys the nonsensical humor that Adult Swim can at times convey.</p>
